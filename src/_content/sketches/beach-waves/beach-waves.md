This sketch was inspired by a trip to Poland and a link between my light theme and the sand.

During the summer we visited the [Slowinksi National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovincian_National_Park) with its vast moving sand dunes, flanked by the sandy beaches of Baltic sea and lake Lebsko.
