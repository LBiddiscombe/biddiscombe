Part 2 of a pair of sketches done for this site. This time, something for the dark theme.

I fancy doing a city skyline with lights at the windows slowly flickering, and I probably still will but while exploring dark themed p5js sketches I came across [this fireworks challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/27-fireworks) on the coding train website - more great work by Daniel Shiffman!

So, why not, we're heading towards firewworks night here after all and they look great!

<mark>But this big gap around the resized sketch doesn't look so great... will fix that soon</mark>

<script>
	import P5Wrapper from '$lib/components/P5Wrapper.svelte';
</script>

<P5Wrapper path={'/sketches/fireworks.js'} />
